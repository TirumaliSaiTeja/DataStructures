# DataStructures

Important topics to be covered in the data structures

Array, Linklist, doubly Linklist
Stack, Queue ( both array and Linklist implementation and there application)
Trees : Binary, BST, AVL there traversing, there implementation and there complexity.
Graph : matrix and adjacency list implementation. DFS, BFS, MST - kruskal & Prims, Dijikstra, Wellman ford will be sufficient.
